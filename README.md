A deep learning model has demonstrated remarkable results in image processing by leveraging a trained dataset. Spinach (palak), a leafy vegetable rich in vitamins and nutrients, was the subject of this project, where a deep learning approach was employed to classify it. A real-time dataset comprising 1,045 images of spinach (palak) was collected from various geographical locations using smartphones. These images were sourced from local vegetable markets and spinach fields.The raw images underwent several preprocessing techniques to prepare the input data for the subsequent stages, enhancing data quality for better machine understanding and analysis. During preprocessing, the images were converted to RGB format, noise was filtered out, and the images were resized and rescaled for consistency. The final dataset consisted of images resized to a height of 224 pixels, a width of 224 pixels, and in RGB color format, resulting in an input shape of 224x224x3 for the model.Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm, the model was trained and evaluated for accuracy. This model classifies spinach (palak) based on freshness using binary classification and assesses nutritional efficiency (highly nutritious or less nutritious) using OpenCV. The model's accuracy, determined by comparing various algorithms, is 92.34%.
